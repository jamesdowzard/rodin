Initial implementation of Whisper Flow

Completed:
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/jamesdowzard/whisper-flow
- Implemented core architecture:
  - Audio recording (sounddevice)
  - Whisper transcription (faster-whisper)
  - AI text editing (Ollama/OpenAI/Anthropic)
  - Text typing at cursor (pynput)
  - Global hotkey handler (pynput)
  - macOS menu bar app (rumps)
  - Configuration management (pydantic)
- Added CLI test commands: --test, --benchmark, --record-test
- Benchmarked performance: ~1s transcription, ~3-4s Ollama editing

Commits:
- 0becb06: Initial implementation
- 240e6fc: Add CLI test and benchmark commands

Issues discovered:
- Microphone permission: Python needs mic access in System Settings > Privacy
- Default audio device may be virtual (Carlo Verbosi) instead of MacBook mic
- Need to use SwitchAudioSource to set correct input device

In progress:
- Floating overlay button (overlay.py) - code written, not tested
- Audio device selection in config

Next steps:
1. Test and debug the floating overlay UI
2. Add proper microphone permission handling
3. Test full end-to-end recording flow
4. Commit uncommitted changes (overlay.py, device selection)

Blockers:
- Microphone not capturing audio in tests (permission or device issue)
